# OPRR Content Component: Context Info

Content Component that captures the information about the context of a project. 

This content component is wel suited to be used as header in every "one page report" and should stay
consistent for a series of reports.

In the examples provided in the "One Page Project Manager" books this component is used to name basic information 
about a project like the project's name, the project manager's name and the main objective of the project.

Here the component has been generalized as to allow different context's to be reported about. It is assumed that ths context of a report 
will name 
1. the report's core item or _topic_ 
2. who is reporting (i.e. the _reporter_) 
3. the _motivation_ for working and reporting on the respective topic.

However labels can be changed to match the examples used in the "One Page Project Manager" books.
