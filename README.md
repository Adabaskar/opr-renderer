Renderer for "one page" reports like motivated in the "One Page Project Manager" books by Campbell.

# Motivation
On several occasions I would have liked to use a "One Page Project Manager" sheet  to get a feel for a planed undertaking (despite not being a project manager) or to report on the current status of a project to different stakesholders. The only technical platforms for this I found, were to use a Microsoft Excel sheet or the paid ["Online Builder and Manager" tool](https://www.oppmi.com/myoppm.cfm). 

I don't know about the technical pros or cons of the online tool, but for me personally it is too expensive as I'm not from the trade. Using Microsoft Excel for my purposes is quite cumbersome especially during intialisation of a sheet and not well suited for refactoring, like switching in or out things or increasing or decreasing columns and rows, and getting a feel for which level of abstraction and what items in the report are relevant.
