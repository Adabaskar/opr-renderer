# opr-renderer
Renderer for "one page" reports like motivated in the "One Page Project Manager" books by Campbell.

# Motivation
The goal of this project is to provide tools for the creation, display and management of One Page Reports like described in the "One Page Project Manager" books by Campbell. Currently the only technical platforms known for this are Microsoft Excel or the paid ["Online Builder and Manager" tool](https://www.oppmi.com/myoppm.cfm).

I don't know about the technical pros or cons of the online tool, but (for me personally) it is too expensive just to give it a try. Using Microsoft Excel is quite cumbersome, especially during intialisation of an OPPM sheet and when refactoring ( i.e. switching in or out things or increasing or decreasing columns and rows). 

The tools created here should therefore be free of charge (MIT), allow easy creation of one page reports and support refactoring.

# Roadmap

In the first stage (Version 0.1.0 "Mariner") a TypeScript based API for the definition and rendering of OPRs in the browser shall be provided.
